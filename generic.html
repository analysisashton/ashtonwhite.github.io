									<h1>About Me<br />
									</h1>
									<p><br>Hi there, my name is Ashton White, and I am a recent BSBM graduate from Tennessee Technological University with a concentration in data analytics and business intelligence. I fell in love with data and data storytelling while taking Statistics, Econometrics, Data Analytics, and Business Intelligence courses. I was fascinated by how data is leveraged to identify patterns and trends, uncover insights, and solve complex business problems.</br>
										<br>While at university, I was also a member of the Data Science League, a student organization that focused on exploring the world of data. Working alongside my peers on data-related projects, I discovered the power of collaboration and the value of a team-based approach to problem-solving.</br>
										<br>Through my coursework and experiences with the Data Science League, I developed a keen eye for detail and a deep appreciation for the importance of data-driven decision-making. I am excited to continue my journey in the world of data and leverage my skills to drive business success through insights and analysis.</br>
										<br>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities you'd like to discuss.</br>
										</p>
